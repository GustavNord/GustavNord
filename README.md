## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### Server and Client Chatroom: [socket-to-em-gustav](https://github.com/WTCSC/socket-to-em-gustav.git)
These two Python scripts are a simple implementation of a client server chat application. The server script creates a server that listens for incoming connections, while the client script
allows users to connect to the server and send and/or receive messages to other clients on the server. The server handles multiple clients at the same time by using threads.
The client can send and receive messages and commands like /exit, /whoami, /help, and /users.

### IP Address Scanner Script: [port-scanner-GustavNord](https://github.com/WTCSC/port-scanner-GustavNord.git)
This script scans a network range specified in CIDR notation (192.168.1.0/24) and reports the status of each IP address in the range. 
The script pings each host and returns the host's status and notes if it's "Up", "Down", or if an error occured during the scan. 
It also includes response times for each successful ping. This script accepts one command-line argument. The network range to scan in CIDR format 192.168.1.0/24.

### MAC Address changer: [mac-address-changer-GustavNord](https://github.com/WTCSC/mac-address-changer-GustavNord.git)
This script allows users to change the MAC address of a network interface. 
It can be used to set a custom MAC address, create a random MAC address, or revert back to the original MAC address. This script handles the installation of macchanger if it's not installed already. It works for both Python and Shell.
