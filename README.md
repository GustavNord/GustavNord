## 🛠️ Projects

- Server and Client Chatroom: [socket-to-em-gustav](https://github.com/WTCSC/socket-to-em-gustav.git)
These two Python scripts are a simple implementation of a client server chat application. The server script creates a server that listens for incoming connections, while the client script
allows users to connect to the server and send and/or receive messages to other clients on the server. The server handles multiple clients at the same time by using threads.
The client can send and receive messages and commands like /exit, /whoami, /help, and /users.
